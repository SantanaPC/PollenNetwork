## Overview

This study investigates the foraging behavior and ecological interactions of **three stingless bee species** rescued from the Bolivian tropical Andes:  
- *Tetragonisca angustula*  
- *Nannotrigona testaceicornis*  
- *Paratrigona opaca*

By analyzing **pollen grains found in the honey** collected from these bee colonies, we evaluated **intra- and interspecific variation** in resource use and **niche overlap**. Our approach provides insights into how different species contribute to plant–pollinator interaction networks and can inform **conservation strategies** for pollinators and native flora.
